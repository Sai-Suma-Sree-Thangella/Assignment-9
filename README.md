SHORT DESCRIPTION:


An introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is given in this session, with a special emphasis on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It focuses on learning the fundamentals of LSTM and investigating different RNN topologies. Sentiment analysis on Twitter data is the practical application, in which sentiments expressed in tweets are analysed using RNNs. Implementing GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to maximise model performance, storing learned models for later use, and making predictions on fresh text input.
